# Algorithms, Data Structures and Problem Solving

## About

Repository to keeps my studies about, Algorithms, Data Structures and Problem Solving minimally organized.

All the stuff in this repository is going to be developed mainly in C++.

## Directories

### algorithms

A directory to keep mainly algorithms focused code.

### data_structures 

A directory to keep mainly data_structures focused code.

### problem_solving

A directory to keep mainly problem solving focused code.

### utils

This directory is going to keep the common functions piece of code, which is going to be used many times by different pieces of code e.g. generate random numbers function.

## TODO's

- [ ] Transform algorithms and data structures into objects
    - [ ] Define a architecture for it
- [ ] Script to compile exercises
- [ ] Transform the entire directory into a library (dll)
